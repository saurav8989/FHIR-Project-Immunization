# ðŸ©º FHIR Project: Child Immunization in Nepal

This project demonstrates how to model childhood immunization data using the **HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources)** standard. It focuses on creating **custom StructureDefinitions (FHIR profiles)** and sample resource instances specific to child immunization practices in Nepal.

## ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

This project can be used for:

- Academic and research purposes.
- Building FHIR-based immunization registries.
- Integrating with national systems (e.g., DHIS2, OpenIMIS).
- Demonstrating FHIR profiling and instance generation.
